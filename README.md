To start use of docker navigate to *container* folder and run the following command: **docker-compose up**

Then navigate to the *application* folder and open the *app.js* file to add any code you want. The config has already been set up for you. You just need to run **node app.js**

Remember to double check if your docker container is running by using Docker Desktop if the *app.js* file is throwing errors.
